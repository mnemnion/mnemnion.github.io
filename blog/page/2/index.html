  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://dotat.at/tmp/gll.pdf">GLL Algorithm</a> is one of those core concepts that can change how we do computation. It&#39;s phenomenally powerful. I believe we&#39;re just starting to see what it&#39;s capable of.</p>

<p>I plan to implement GLL, as soon as some of the support work is done. It&#39;s going to be a somewhat leisurely task. I&#39;m taking a lot of notes. Currently, I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">Instaparse</a> to play around with the algorithm.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fantastic stuff, much more flexible as an idiom than, say, ANTLR. It is also much easier to write yourself into an exponential corner, and I find myself abusing regular expressions somewhat rather than torturing the grammar in other ways. </p>

<p>I think this is a consequence of GLL&#39;s strengths, which allow it to parse out well over data that is already in a nested structure. Using it for a shallower kind of pattern matching kills performance even in parallel execution, because at any point in matching a long string of related structures, it could encounter a context that would kill the whole chain of inquiry. If there is any possibility of ambiguous matching, this explodes even faster. </p>

<p>An example of this kind of use is parsing a bunch of sentences and paragraphs into text, which is words and whitespace. Except if you encounter a special character you have to switch context completely; this last requirement makes most natural ways of writing the grammar fail. </p>

<p>An alternative would be progressive refinement. In Instaparse, the latest definition of a rule is used, and all earlier rules are ignored. My proposal, which I intend to use in my own work, is that multiple definitions of the same rule are tried sequentially against the data, after a successful parse.</p>

<p>This would damage the arbitrarily-ordered nature of Instaparse grammars, in a sense. Instaparse still has to decide what to do with multiple definitions, and currently uses the last one provided. </p>

<p>This would just formalize something one can already do with Instaparse, which is to parse a string, flatten the area of interest back into a string, and re-parse that string into a new rule. Substitute your new parse for the old one (this is very easy), and you&#39;ve done it.</p>

<p>Automating that into the grammar would allow one to grab large globs of identical data, switching context when necessary, then parse that data into shape in smaller pieces that don&#39;t have to worry about context boundaries. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a straightforward adaptation, being properly speaking a composition of the same function, <code>insta/parse grammar</code>, over a subset of the data returned by the first call. </p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Automated profiling</h2>

<p>One neat thing about grammars is that you can run them backwards to generate compliant gibberish. As you&#39;d expect, given the vast difference in magnitude between the set of valid input of a given length and the set of all input of that same length, it is quick to use Markov type rules to generate babble for even an intricate, ambigous grammar that would blow up trying to validate the output.</p>

<p>In fact, that&#39;s the point. One may envision, and I may even write, a tool that uses pseudorandom walks to generate longer and longer streams of valid gibberish, and try them against the grammar, looking for suspicious jumps in speed or number of possible parses. Even a naive tool, running on a remote server, would generate useful information while developing a parser. One may envision the tool dialing in where parses go ambigous, generating input accordingly, and alerting the user, or doing the same for square and cubic factors that show up.</p>

<p>If the validity of the babble is questionable, then one has identified permission within the grammer that one may wish to eliminate. It has potential.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Euno/lp.html">Literate Programming</a> is one of those paradigms whose fate is continual reinvention. I&#39;ve been noticing that my software projects start as Markdown. It stands to reason that they should end up as Markdown as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Git Flavored Markdown</a>, in particular, is crying out for a literate, multi-model programming system. The mechanism of named fenced code blocks lets one put multiple languages in a single file, and they will already be syntax highlighted according to the named language. </p>

<p>As literate programming is for the ages, we shall call our system <a href="README.md">Marmion</a>. The weaver shall be known as <a href="athena.md">Athena</a>; the tangler, <a href="">Arachne</a>.</p>

<p>If at all possible, we don&#39;t want to touch GFM itself. Therefore, here are some principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Code in fenced code blocks is extracted, macro-expanded, and executed in whatever ways are appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Macros must employ patterns not used in a given language; therefore, we must be able to define those patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>All configuration happens in special code blocks, called <code>```config</code>:</p></li>
</ul>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="s">&quot;A config file&quot;</span>,
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:format</span> <span class="ss">:edn</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:magic-number</span> <span class="mi">42</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">;this is actually tagged ```clojure</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<ul>
<li><p>Code in regular unfenced code blocks is not included in the weave. Nor are fenced code blocks that aren&#39;t reached from the top macro. The code above, for example, <em>will not</em> be in the finished weave, because it is exemplary.</p></li>
<li><p>All text ends up in the tangle, which is an HTML file. No other tangle format is contemplated. </p></li>
<li><p>If standardized, the tangle format will not be specified, only the markup format and the requirements for the subsequent weave. HTML is a moving target, as is visual display in general. </p></li>
<li><p>The Markdown may be extended, but only in the same way as any other code: by specifying a macro template and expanding it from provided code. It is the macro-expanded Markdown which is tangled and woven.</p></li>
<li><p>Corollary: the Markdown is macro expanded before anything in a code block.  </p></li>
<li><p>Corollary: the Markdown macro will be standard. There should be no reason to include it. Because Clojure is the implementation language, and has a defined reader macro syntax, this is already true of Clojure(Script).</p></li>
<li><p>The weaver should visit all internal links in search of code. Some tag in HTML form should be provided so that fully-marked-up links, so tagged, will also be followed in search of exterior code. </p></li>
<li><p>If exterior code is requested, it is added to the source as a fenced code block. The tangle will preserve the link directly above the code block. Some sensible effort will be made to infer the code format from the file extension. This is to be done before macro expansion, so that if there are macros in the exterior code, they will be expanded.</p></li>
<li><p>We should maintain a set of canonical macro patterns for languages, to encourage mutual compatibility in source and tangled code.</p></li>
<li><p>No mechanism for transclusion on the file level will be provided. The file structure of the Markdown is the file structure of the tangle. Working around this using the tagged-link method will leave a broken link in your tangle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the sort of project that we can tackle in stages. The most important part is the weaver, because we have a fine tangler in the form of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. </p>

<p>This is a job for <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. The weaver and perhaps the tangler will be Clojurescript compatible in the narrow sense, but useless unless Instaparse is ported, which seems unlikely, though you never know. </p>

<p>Clojure is chosen for a few reasons. <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">EDN</a>, for one, which will be the format of any <code>```config</code> code block. Also because of <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">Instaparse</a>, for which the usual regular-expression based markup approach is a strict subset of capabilities. It has the best story I&#39;m aware of for setting regular expressions declaratively in a data format, which is exactly how we will provide macros. </p>

<p>To be clear, this will let us syntax highlight a provided macro in a distinctive way, and put things like the colors to use right in the markdown. This is only useful with a completed weaver; Pygments will get the macros wrong but this is a minor stylistic matter which can be corrected by retangling with a better highlighter. </p>

<p>Instaparse is my go-to choice for writing flexible parsers that are meant to be shared, so Clojure it is. I hope Instaparse catches on to the point where it becomes core, and hence worth maintaining separate <code>.clj</code> and <code>.cljs</code> versions. </p>

<p>The first, and most important step, is writing <a href="athena.md">Athena</a>, the weaver. The weaver does the following: finds all the <code>```config</code> code, parses it to configure itself, then goes after the code blocks, and uses the macros and config information to construct the weave. Finally, it calls the trigger file, which must contain everything needed to build the weave into an executable, or whatever the final product is.</p>

<p>The tangler, <a href="">Arachne</a>, should be a <a href="https://github.com/mnemnion/jekyll">fork of Jekyll</a>, with a low surface area of interaction. What I mean by this is that merges between the bases should avoid touching one another&#39;s files wherever possible. The only changes I contemplate personally is to plug-replace the syntax highlighter, for several reasons. </p>

<p>Pygments requires one to write actual code to markup a new format. This is distasteful. Also, we need to markup the macros, which we won&#39;t know until we weave the code. Furthermore, a static syntax highlighter should be based on a powerful parser, not a regular engine janked up with extra Python. </p>

<p>If Marmion becomes popular, someone might want to write advanced capabilities: putting compatible code in a REPL, for example, or linking to one from the code, or linking to the <a href="https://github.com/mnemnion/emojure/blob/master/src/emojure/core.clj#L7">line number</a> in a public Github repository generated by the weaver. The last is particularly powerful. All of this will assuredly be easier with a parser-backed tangler. </p>

<p>This is the only way I have to tackle large problems: recursing through the Big Project until I hit something atomic and critical to further progress. Arc leads to GGG, which will benefit greatly from a literate style, which leads to Marmion. Marmion built, writing GGG in an understandable way becomes possible. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve painted myself into a corner, as I can&#39;t think of anything offhand which I need to write in order to write Marmion. </p>

<p>Time to generate more Markdown!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I find it somewhat astonishing that the languages with which I&#39;m familiar still start and end strings with the same character. It is as though we used <code>|</code> for <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> in code blocks and relied on context to figure out if it was <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code>. </p>

<p>Incidentally, it&#39;s quite possible to write a language this way, and an interesting exercise. <code>for | i = 0 ; i &lt; 2 ; i++ || codeBlock |</code> should parse just fine. Heaven help you if you misplace anything. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Bracket_delimiters">bracket delimiters</a> on the Wiki. Two of these things are not like the others. Those two are used preponderantly for strings. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear enough how it happened. A string has an obvious mapping to literary quotation: <code>&quot;That&#39;s what she said!&quot;</code>.  ASCII gives us exactly three options: <code>&#39;</code>, <code>`</code>, and <code>&quot;</code>. <a href="http://c-programming.itags.org/q_c-programming-language_16297.html">It turns out</a> that C was defined using 91 characters, and <code>`</code> was not among them. </p>

<p>Meta enough, I&#39;m writing this in Markdown, and to type <code>`</code>, I must type <code>`` ` ``</code>. I will leave how I typed <code>`` ` ``</code> as an exercise for the reader. </p>

<p>So C chose <code>&quot;</code> for string syntax, and <code>&#39;</code> for characters, and these decisions made sense, somewhere in the mists of time. C also initiated the proud tradition of string escaping, which wasn&#39;t invented to get around the delimiter problem, but which can be used for that purpose in a hacky way. String escaping is so you can say <code>\n</code> and get a newline, the incidental benefit is you can say <code>\&quot;</code> and get a <code>&quot;</code>, hence one may include any character in such a string. Two backslashes is of course <code>\\\\</code>. One gets used to it. </p>

<p>Oh hey, just for fun, why not write a regex that will match such strings? Won&#39;t take you long, I promise. I&#39;ll be right here!</p>

<p>To the point. In typography, we don&#39;t do this. We start quotations with <code>“</code> or <code>‟</code> and end them with <code>”</code>. On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%AB">Continent</a>, <code>«</code> and <code>»</code> are used, and this would be my preference as they are much easier to tell apart and don&#39;t have two choices for the opening delimiter. If you follow the link, It turns out they are used both <code>«this way»</code> and <code>»this way«</code> and even <code>»this way»</code> by Finns (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language">of course</a>). We favor the first, because all other brackets in computer programming are inward facing <code>&lt;{[(like so)]}&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the point? They aren&#39;t on standard keyboards in the US; while any worthwhile editor can get around this, there&#39;s a pain point there. Some people will argue a virtue in using ASCII for source code, and while those people <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit">have a point</a>, the ship sailed a long time ago. We use Unicode, and it isn&#39;t going anywhere. </p>

<p>The point is that, without proper left-right matched strings, you cannot literally quote your own source code within your source code. This is damaged, for any language that lets you evaluate at runtime (the interesting ones IOW). If we use <code>«</code> and <code>»</code>, we can use bog-standard reference counting to assure that any properly-balanced literal strings in the source code get quoted. Since in this imaginary syntax a bare <code>»</code> not balanced on the left with a <code>«</code> is a syntax error, any correct program can be embedded. </p>

<p>If, for any reason, you need a bare <code>»</code>, why not use the ISO standard SHA-1 hash of the Unicode value of <code>»</code>? Why not indeed. It then becomes impossible to literally quote that one hash, which is officially the point where it is perverse to pursue the matter further. Concatenate for that one. </p>

<p>To be clear, <code>&quot;</code> for escaped strings is concise and well understood, and with enough convolutions one may write as one pleases. It&#39;s syntax such as <code>&#39;&#39;&#39;</code> for literal strings that grates against my sensibilities. </p>

<p>Clojure has no syntax for literal, multi-line, unescaped strings. That&#39;s too bad; no one does syntax like Rich Hickey, and I suspect that the inadequacy of existing options plays a role here. He may not be willing to go off-keyboard, but I feel that the <code>«</code> and <code>»</code> syntax has a lot to offer. Certainly Europeans would be pleased. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="toc_6">Representation of Data in Structured Programs.</h3>

<p>Today we&#39;re going to discover a programming language. We&#39;re going to start by contemplating the idea of code as data. </p>

<p>LISP, and by the all-caps I mean the original flavours, had two fundamental forms: atoms, and lists. As Lisp grew up, the lists became able to represent any sort of data type, but at the expense of a certain homoiconicity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a controversial assertion, but hear me out. A list in a Lisp is a bunch of cons cells, it&#39;s a specific data structure used by default to do pretty much anything. Since the first position (first second third) has a function or a macro, you can fake, say a hash, by saying something like (hash a a-prime b b-prime) but here&#39;s the problem: that&#39;s not homoiconic to your data anymore. Not in a way that accords with modern expectations. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about JSON. Now, JSON is homoiconic to your data. <code>{}</code>? Object. <code>[]</code>? List. <code>&quot;&quot;</code>? String. <code>(1-9)(digits*)</code>? Number. And so on. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ent is a new approach to code creation. It is (will be) an editor and library that works on parse trees, rather than on files, and registers all changes as <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/understanding-and-applying-operational-transformation">operational transformations</a>. It does so through the medium of familiar code files, but these may be thought of as an interface to the code, and as a product of it, similar to the executable binaries produced by a compiler. </p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Parse Aware Editing of Structured Files</h3>

<p>ent&#39;s major rationale is parse-awareness. It will, in general, not allow you to type invalid code, though this can always be overridden. It will parse your code as you create it, storing the resulting file as a series of operational transformations on the parse tree. As a language is more thoroughly defined within ent, this enables REPL-like instant feedback and sophisticated refactoring. </p>
