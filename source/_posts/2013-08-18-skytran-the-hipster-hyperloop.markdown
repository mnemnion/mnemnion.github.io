I was into Hyperloop before it was cool.

I matriculated in 2005, with a degree that started in computer science and ended in the genetics department. This was my idea of how to solve the transportation crisis: recapitulate the process by which fossil fuels are created from living matter. That this would lock in the stinky, poisonous, inefficient internal combustion engine as an eternal fact of nature in our species: this did not occur to me. I was thinking, well, we have a lot of cars, and they only burn rock goo, so lets make more goo, just not from rocks.

So I went to work for a biofuels company. Their master plan for saving the human race was to wipe out large swaths of desert ecosystem, replacing it with bright-green raceway ponds full of glyphosate and genetically modified fuel-bearing algae. With diligent and comprehensive destruction, not to mention some fat subsidies, we figure we could replace a few percent of fossil fuels.

Oh, and we need a source of carbon dioxide. Right there next to the pond. Algae are hungry beasts.

My friends thought I was saving the world. They were so grateful. I felt like an ass. I also felt like I had the wrong goddamn degree: I managed to escape university knowing next to nothing about electricity and how to harness it. 

Somewhere between degree and job, I discovered [SkyTran](http://skytran.net). The old version of the website is **much** more informative and entertaining. It restored my faith in humanity. We'll be discussing the idea in detail in this post: just check out the front page for now.

Mind you, at the time, Elon Musk was the PayPal guy. I've been impressed by Tesla Motors, and Google's self-driving cars. But I've always been aware that there is a better solution for the 80% of car travel that happens in less than 20% of inhabited land. 

Elon thinks he has that problem licked. I would too, if I were him. But gridlock that uses no power (since a stationary electric vehicle consumes minimal energy) and produces no noxious fume, while better, is still gridlock. Replacing every car in the Bay Area with an electric wouldn't get you over the bridge any faster. A total switch to self-driving cars would help.

When Elon Musk started hinting about Hyperloop, my immediate thought was "no way it could be as cool as SkyTran". I'm convinced SkyTran is one of those solutions that you can only reinvent if you don't have it: attempts to solve the same problem either look a lot like SkyTran, or are meaningfully worse in some dimensions. With Hyperloop, it is both. 

The similarities are clear enough: both propel passengers on a non-contact bearing, via linear induction, and are powered by solar panels above the track. Both travel on pylons or supports, keeping the right-of-way below them relatively clear. Both hinge their pitch on the fact that they can exceed the projected SF-LA time for the California High Speed Rail initiative. 

Hyperloop's obvious sell point over SkyTran is the higher top speed, roughly 4 times that of SkyTran. Every other advantage is in SkyTran's camp. 

I assume my audience is familiar with Hyperloop, and has never heard of SkyTran. Hence the post title: It's from the 90s, it's better than Hyperloop, you've probably never heard of it, and I was into it way before Hyperloop was cool.

##SkyTran

Skytran is a small, 2 person pod, that rides on a maglev bearing. The track is roughly 60 cm high and 30 cm wide, and the total right of way for a craft is on the order of 2 meters diameter. Top speed is potentially quite high: for various reasons, 150mph (~240kph) is the target number.

Oh, and SkyTran: It exists. I've seen it. They're testing it down at Moffet field. The whole thing is moving achingly slowly. If only they had a darling of the tech press doing their PR. 

Skytran's maglev system is dirt simple and completely brilliant. Called [Inductrack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductrack), it was developed in the 70s at Lawrence Livermore and has been extensively proven in the lab. It's basically a bunch of neodymium magnets, stacked and bonded together in a way that they don't really like, with the net effect that, pushed forward, it will float via induction on an induction coil or plates. The only feedback system is a lower-powered array of magnets on the bottom of the track, which keeps it from floating free if the load is below capacity. 

My calculations suggest that to levitate 315 kg, a decent weight, each craft would require 1.6 kg of pure neodymium. Neodymium is not rare. Despite growing need for it (every windmill has an enormous amount, with scaled amounts in all high quality electric motor), it is still not separated from cesium for such applications as fluorescent lightbulbs. In China, where it is all produced, the combined lanthanides are heavily used as fertilizer, despite this probably being a terrible idea. 

America has a vast strategic supply of the stuff in the ground. We don't mine it for 'environmental reasons' that amount to the fact that the Chinese are pulling it out by the dozerload, straight from the ground, and selling it so cheap we'd need our own slaves to keep up. 

I mean to reassure the reader that the roughly 2 billion pods we'd need to replace 80% of existing car traffic could be constructed. The rest of the pod is small amounts of aluminum, with the bulk made of polymers and composites. Maybe we'll make them with algae goo. There's still lots of sticky rock goo, though, and we may as well durably bind the carbon if we're going to mine it. 

The maglev is the only interesting part of the system. The craft are propelled on box-monorails at appropriately high speeds, any track goes exactly one direction, and you get on and get off wherever you're going. It's packet switched, and follows Metcalfe's law. The first track is useful, and each station added increases the value of every other station. Outdoor stations look like elevated bus platforms, indoor stations are much like getting into a sitdown elevator. 

##The Comparison

Any case such as this should begin with charity. Hyperloop is brilliantly designed, and there is room for it on the planet. Perhaps four Hyperloops is the right number: Moscow to Beijing, for example, or Sydney to Perth. Thing is, if we start building Skytran, we may not get around to it. 

The reason this *might* be attractive is top speed and carrying capacity. Skytran could be jacked up to almost 300mph, with significant expenditure of energy and a big roiling ball of turbulence following each pod. We could stick it in a partially evacuated tube! Then we're Hyperlooping and don't need the magnets or rail anymore, just the tube. Skytran's intercity sweet spot is 150mph, with a big selling point being that it's efficient at slower speeds for intra-city transportation.
