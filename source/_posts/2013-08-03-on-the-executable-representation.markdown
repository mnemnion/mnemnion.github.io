This will not publish before I finally write a Nock interpreter. 

The Martian universe gets referenced a lot in GGG. There's a reason for that.

There are three names in the Martian world that stick out: Urbit, Hoon, and Nock. Urbit I relate to as lyrical poetry about the Right Thing To Do. Also, it's being written! You can download it and compile it and run it! It does... not nothing. It will do more, I'm confident. 

Hoon is the language Urbit is being written in. cgy is happy with it. I am reminded of ASCII APL, but in a good way. Our Yarvin is a master of the English language and will doubtless offer an entertaining, insightful, and penetrating guide to his own work, in due time. I gather he wants to finish the fsking thing. 

Dig it, and I can imagine a future where Hoon is a Jedi language of choice. Particularly if Urbit succeeds. It's a compliment to the whole body of work that Hoon is the only language I have rejected for functional GGG. It means the others aren't worth considering and I'll need my own. 

Nock, though. Nock is a brilliant gem: crystalline, tight, and somewhat severe. It may be worth some exegesis to explore possible points of departure.

Nock beings with a short front matter containing three definitions: 

```
A noun is an atom or a cell.  

An atom is any natural number. 

A cell is any ordered pair of nouns.
```
