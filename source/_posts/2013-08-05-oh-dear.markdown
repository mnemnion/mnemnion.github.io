It would seem the weaver produces the documentation and the tangler produces the code.

Of course it does. How very silly of me. 

All documentation will have to be updated accordingly.

I mean, this is work of literature and I got the main characters wrong. 

I am a headstrong and hubristic mortal. Woe is me.

That woe may not be mine, this error must needs be corrected. The blog will go through a purging the Stasi would be proud of. 

Mea Culpa, and my sincerest apologies, Goddess, Muses and Knuth.
