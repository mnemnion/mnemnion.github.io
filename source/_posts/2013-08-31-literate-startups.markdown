You are a publishing house. It's time to start acting like one.

The physical assets of a software company consists of a corpus of text. In a traditional publishing house, there are authors, who write the text, editors, who prepare it for publication, and publishers, who publish the text and deal with the interface between the public and the authors. Publishers also take care of all company management. 

Is your startup structured in this fashion? If not, why not? Does the fact that your publication is code, not paper, change a single fact in this equation?

It does not. We refer to the general lack of editors as "technical debt". We attempt to make up for the lack of editors with code review, test-driven development, and continuous integration. All lovely things. Of them, code review is the only one that is vaguely like editing.

To make this work, a startup must move entirely to a literate programming environment. All executable code, without exception, is embedded in a Markdown file. The code belongs to the authors, and the prose belongs to the editors, even though the authors write most of it. 

Editors and authors collaborate frequently, the most important shared task being the large structure of the codex. Refactoring is done in fundamentally literate ways, and is where editor/author interaction becomes most intricate.

It is perfectly alright if someone is both an excellent author and an excellent editor. This situation is neither common in traditional letters nor is it expected. I expect software will recognize these specialties and react accordingly.
