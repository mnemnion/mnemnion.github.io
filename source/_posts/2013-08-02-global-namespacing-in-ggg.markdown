GGG is a standard, which will not be required to be attached to the Internet to function. Therefore, global namespacing will be a social problem, not a technical one.

The solution to this problem will be to reserve all globals shorter than eight characters for namespaces which are standard or definitive. Make your top level rule names descriptive and all will be well. A typical grammar never calls the top rule itself, so this is not too much to ask. 

...That's about it. Digital feudalism by benevolent dictatorship, basically. The idea is that the short names are identities rather than values, so that, for example, `python` and all accented variants are saved for the best existing Python grammars. Nothing with an underscore will be used, namespace freely.
