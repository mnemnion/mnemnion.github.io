Entropy does not exist. This is not a philosophical statement. Nor is it a theory, nor does it imply any previously unknown facts about Universe. 

It is a statement on the level of saying "cold does not exist" or "darkness does not exist". The difference is only that our physics reflects our understanding of cold and darkness, but is precisely inverted with respect to entropy. 

Let's dispense with cold and darkness first. When we say that something is cold, we mean only that it has less heat than something else. There is a minimum temperature, absolute zero, below which no system can fall. There is no corresponding maximum temperature. Empirically, the highest temperature which can be inferred from data was that achieved by the Big Bang singularity. 

Note for cosmologists and kin: I am being informal throughout this post. Let us agree that, at some point, the Big Bang manifested the qualities I'm speaking of. Give me an entire millisecond's slack, I beg you. 

As with cold, so with darkness. We view light as fluctuations in a field, and it is possible in principle to reduce these fluctuations to a certain minimum floor. The void itself fluctuates randomly, so that floor is not an absolute lack of light. The highest degree of EM fluctuation empirically observed is also the Big Bang singularity. 

On a mathematics level, it is simplest by far to treat both heat and light as positive. This is the case in all normal physics and in most of the weird corners as well. Such exotica as negative absolute temperature proove the rule rather than except it: they are weird edge cases of the math that are sometimes found to apply in practice. 

Entropy is the same way. There is an actual quality of a system, which we'll call entaxy today, though it has at least six synonyms in common use. It has a certain minimum for any system, which we, bewilderingly, call the maximum entropy of that system. 

Here's the issue: heat and light are the same thing, and are conserved quantities. Entaxy is not conserved, rather the contrary, it is always and only used up and must be continually imported. 

Nevertheless, entropy is the floor and entaxy the ceiling. The highest observed entaxy is the Big Bang, and our theoretical highest entropy system, the Heat Death of the Universe, is around 3 Kelvin. QED.
