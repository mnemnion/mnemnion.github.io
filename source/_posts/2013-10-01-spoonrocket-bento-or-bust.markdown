I'm in the SpoonRocket test area. Lucky me! I'm also a vegetarian, which means I'm hitting half the menu.

When SpoonRocket wins, it wins. The delivery model is superb, and it all hinges on one meal per group. I either like that meal or not, and if I do, I'm inclined to order it.  

I feel like SpoonRocket is on the verge of a winning model, and it's an easy pivot: redesign both meals around a bento box, with everything that entails.

This doesn't mean all Japanese food, all the time. Far from it. What I'm picturing is a physical, reusable bento box, with a dollar checkout fee. It would have internal dividers to prevent the pile-of-mush sensation I get from roughly half the deliveries. 

This would also mean a predictable amount of grain, 'meat', and exactly three vegetables/sides, each time. The balance of foods in a traditional bento box is, in my humble opinion, perfect, and may be adjusted to any cuisine one wishes. 

Today, I got a box with some beans, some baba ganoush, some salsa, and some sauteed vegetables. It was pretty good, except I didn't like the sauteed vegetables much, and the ganoush was not so tasty with the salsa. Since everything ran together, this made everything only ok. There was also an unreasonable amount of baba ganoush given the amount of tortilla. 

Nitpicking, sure, but design around a bento and this problem is gone. This meal had beans for the 'meat' and tortillas for the grain, I'd probably toss in a little spanish rice or quinoa and smaller, separated portions of the salsa, baba ganoush, and sauteed vegetable. 

Nothing really needed to change today but the box and the resulting portions. If SpoonRocket goes bento, I see them succeeding in a big way. 

Creating two delicious meals daily out of a changing landscape of local food is already challenging: the constraint provided by the bento format solves enough of the problem. The chef may focus on making the components delicious, while knowing in advance what kinds of food are needed in what amount: these are the same every day.
