<div class="highlight"><pre>I begin to sing of Pallas Athena, the glorious Goddess, bright-eyed,  
inventive, unbending of heart,  
pure virgin, saviour of cities,  
courageous, Tritogeneia. Wise Zeus himself bare her  
from his awful head, arrayed in warlike arms  
of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed.  
But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head 
and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis,  
shaxing a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly 
at the might of the bright-eyed Goddess, 
and earth round about cried fearfully,  
and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves,  
while foam burst forth suddenly:  
the bright Son of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, 
      until the maiden Pallas Athena had stripped the heavenly armour 
      from her immortal shoulders.  
And wise Zeus was glad.
